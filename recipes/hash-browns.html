        <h2>Description:</h2>   
            <p>These classic diner-style hash browns are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 Russet Potatoes</li>
                <li>3 Tablespoons Clarified Butter</li>
                <li>Salt and Ground Black Pepper to Taste</li>
                <li>1 Pinch of Cayenne Pepper</li>
                <li>1 Pinch of Paprika</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Shred potatoes into a large bowl filled with cold water. Stir until water is cloudy, drain, and cover potatoes again with fresh cold water.</li>
                <li>Stir again to dissolve excess starch. Drain potatoes well, pat dry with paper towels, and squeeze out any excess moisture.</li>
                <li>Heat clarified butter in a large non-stick pan over medium heat. Sprinkle shredded potatoes into the hot butter and season with salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and paprika.</li>
                <li>Cook potatoes until a brown crust forms on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook and stir until potatoes are browned all over, about 5 more minutes.</li>
            </ol>
